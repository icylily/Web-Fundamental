            <h2>Javascript Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform,object-oriented scripting language.
                Javascript is extremely pupulare for a variety of reasons. It is a small and 
                lightweight language allowing flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
                JavaScript lives inside a host enviroment(a web browsr or Node server),it can be connected to the objects
                of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="color1">Variable Declaration </span>JavaScriptvariables are containers for storing data values-imagine a cup you fill with coffee,the cup holds the coffee.
                    a variable holds a value. All JavaScriptvariables must be identified with unique names.These unique names are called identifiers, <span class="color2"> var x;</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="color1">Variable Assignment </span>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables-our cup can now have coffee poured in it,giving our
                    variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="color2">var x =10;</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="color1">Data types </span>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.
                There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean <span class="color2">- true</span> or<span class="color2"> false; </span>null <span class="color2">- null </span>aka nothing; Number<span class="color2">- 42</span>
                or<span class="color2"> 3.14159;</span> String -<span class="color2"> "Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array <span class="color2">- [l, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'J]; </span>and Object<span class="color2"> - {first_name: 'Jane',
                last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="color1">Conditionals </span>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different
                code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to
                accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements<span class="color2"> if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our
                code block; <span class="color2">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="color2">else </span>we execute this block of
                code;
                </li>
                <li>
                <span class="color1">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every pro · g language, but they all essentially do the same thing:
                they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four
                times and then you stop. That’s a loop!
                </li>
                <li>
                  
                   
                    <span class="color1">Function</span> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think
                    of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the
                    instruction manual and get star1ted, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way
                    up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over
                    and over again.
